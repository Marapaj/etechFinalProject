        <p class="parag1">Hello, everyone! My name is Marc Lance Casino of ABM 11 and I was born on July 26, 2005 and as of now Im only 17 years old turning 18. When I was 4 years old I was already studying in Divine Light Academy and till now I am still here in Divine Light Academy stepping aside. I love playing sports like basketball, volleyball, badminton, and swimming. I am a jolly and active person so playing sports is easy for me. I also love playing online games like ML, CODM, ROS, Valorant for me. Playing online games makes me happy yet sometimes getting tilted or getting mad easily because of the noob teammates. I can also ride a bike and play rubik's cube I can do many things but one thing for sure it is hard for me to play a instruments even though I love listening to music I can't play a instruments maybe it is not my talent but I am willing to learn because playing instruments is cool and fun.</p>
